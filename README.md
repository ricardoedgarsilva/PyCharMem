<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

PyCharMem is a robust Python-based software, engineered to perform electrical characterization on memristive devices. It conducts these measurements under a range of conditions dictated by a user-configured file, thereby offering a great deal of flexibility and control.

Developed by Ricardo E. Silva, PyCharMem is openly licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0, with the source code readily accessible on GitHub, promoting transparency and community-based enhancements.

PyCharMem furnishes both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI). The CLI permits users to select a specific measurement type, key in the necessary parameters, and initiate the measurement. Simultaneously, the GUI presents an intuitive platform for real-time results visualization, enhancing user understanding and interaction.

The inception of PyCharMem traces back to a comprehensive research project at INESC-MN Lisbon, Portugal, a testament to its scientific rigor and reliability.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites


PyCharMem is compatible with all operating systems that support Python 3.9 or above. This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to install Python 3.9 or a newer version. Afterward, you'll need to acquire a National Instruments GPIB card and install the specific NI-VISA drivers for your case. If your device is not listed in the /instruments directory, you will need to generate a file using the "template.py" file provided in the same folder. This will serve as a communication bridge between your device and the system, effectively functioning as an API.

Firstly, you will need to install the Python requirements. Execute the following command to do so:

  ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
